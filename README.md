An array and an array list, in Java, are two different functions that may provide very similar outputs depending on the situation as they are both used to store the same data type. The array function in java has the ability to hold a specific number of elements, that has been previously declared within the program. This function will only store elements of the same data type, and will only display the number of elements that has been indicates, as the size can not be changed when the program is called on later in the program. However, an array list has the ability to change sizes as needed. Additionally, unlike a normal array, an array list is able to store elements of any data type. Finally, the function is able to display any number of values as identified with in other parts of the program.

Therefore, although both of these functions have the ability to contain and display a list of values, an array list maintains a large amount of flexibility and adaptability when compared to that of an array.
